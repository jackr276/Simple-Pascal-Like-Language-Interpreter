# Simple Pascal-Like Language Interpreter
Author : [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276)

## Executive Summary
This project is an interpreter for an interpreted Pascal-like programming language. Interpreted languages, such as the language in this project and more well known ones like **Python** and **R**. are executed line-by-line, as opposed to compiled languages where programs are translated into machine code all at once before execution.  The interpreter for this language is made up of two main copmonents, a [tokenizer/lexical analyzer](https://github.com/jackr276/Simple-Pascal-Like-Language-Interpreter/blob/main/lex.cpp), and a [recursive-descent parser/interpreter](https://github.com/jackr276/Simple-Pascal-Like-Language-Interpreter/blob/main/parserInterp.cpp). To help show how this programming language is supposed to look and function, there are numerous example programs provided in the [tests folder](https://github.com/jackr276/Simple-Pascal-Like-Language-Interpreter/tree/main/tests). 

The code is well documented within the files itself, but for a full and complete explanation, I strongly recommend reading the full write-up that follows this executive summary.
