# Simple Pascal-Like Language Interpreter
Author : [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276)

## Executive Summary
This project is an interpreter for an interpreted Pascal-like programming language. Interpreted languages, such as the language in this project and more well known ones like **Python** and **R**, are executed line-by-line, as opposed to compiled languages where programs are translated into machine code all at once before execution.  The interpreter for this language is made up of two main copmonents, a [tokenizer/lexical analyzer](https://github.com/jackr276/Simple-Pascal-Like-Language-Interpreter/blob/main/lex.cpp), and a [recursive-descent parser/interpreter](https://github.com/jackr276/Simple-Pascal-Like-Language-Interpreter/blob/main/parserInterp.cpp). To help show how this programming language is supposed to look and function, there are numerous example programs provided in the [tests folder](https://github.com/jackr276/Simple-Pascal-Like-Language-Interpreter/tree/main/tests). 

The code is well documented within the files itself, but for a full and complete explanation, I strongly recommend reading the full write-up that follows this executive summary.

## Extended Backus-Naur Form(EBNF) Meta-syntax
EBNF is a notation/ruleset for formally describing context-free grammars. Context-free grammars are described 

Listed below are some important EBNF rules that are vital in understanding the EBNF rules for this specific language, which are contained in the next section.

1. Any character not defined in the rules below is considered to be either a _nonterminal_ or a _terminal_
  *Nonterminals are, as their name suggests, items that can be changed
